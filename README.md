# Godot Multi-Scene Editor Plugin
A Batch Scene Editor Plugin for Godot for Godot 3.x

### Tired of manually applying the same edits to scenes one-by-one? Then this plugin is for **YOU!**

## What This Plugin Does
With this plugin you can make the same edits to multiple scenes with a few clicks! Resource paths of the modified scenes can be changed so you can rename the modified scenes

## The following operations are currently supported:
- Instance packed scene
- Apply script to node
- Apply material to mesh instance(s)
- Remove nodes of a given name

## Installation 
This plugin functions like other standard Godot editor plugins. Copy the contents of the `multi_scene_editor` folder into the `res://addons` folder in your project and enable the plugin via the project settings.

## Godot 4.0?
Although not currently tested, I plan on updating this plugin to work with Godot 4.x when a stable version is released.

## An operation I need is not available
If you would like to add an operation, feel free to fork the repo and create it! Due to the wide variety of use-cases, I don't have the resources to implement every potential operation, but the base has been designed to be as extendable as possible.

Alternatively, you can create a proposal by opening a Github issue and describing the operation you would like to see.

## Support me
